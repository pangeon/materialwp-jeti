Without the following projects/people this theme wouldn't be possible:

- http://getbootstrap.com

## Customization
Basic colors changes can be made in the WordPress Customizer ( Appearance -> Customize -> Colors).

If you need to further customize the theme, it is recommended that you first create a child theme so you will be able to update the theme in the future. You can read how to create a WordPress Child theme [here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes).

### Developers 

1. Run `npm install` to install Node.js dependencies
2. Run `gulp` this will start all watch tasks and run browser-sync
3. Start making customizations
